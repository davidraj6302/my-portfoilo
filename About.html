      <h3>Frontend Web Developer & Problem Solver</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Pudami Devid Raju from Hyderabad, a 3rd-year B.Tech student at IIIT Bhagalpur. 
        I completed my schooling at Rama Krishna Vidyalaya and intermediate at Narayana Junior College. 
        My passion lies in creating engaging and visually appealing web experiences while ensuring they are functional, fast, and user-friendly.
        Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend frameworks. 
        I also enjoy solving coding challenges that enhance my problem-solving mindset, and I believe every project is an opportunity to learn and grow.

      <p>
        I’m constantly exploring new ways to solve problems through clean, efficient, and user-focused web solutions. 
        My interest in technology began during school when I discovered the joy of building something from scratch. 
        Since then, I have worked on several personal projects, ranging from portfolio websites to small interactive applications, 
        each helping me refine my understanding of design principles, accessibility, and performance optimization.
        Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, listening to music, traveling to new places, and engaging in meaningful conversations that spark creativity and insight.
