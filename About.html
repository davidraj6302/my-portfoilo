      <h3>Frontend Web Developer & Problem Solver</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Pudami Devid Raju from Hyderabad, a 3rd-year B.Tech student at IIIT Bhagalpur. 
        I completed my schooling at Rama Krishna Vidyalaya and intermediate at Narayana Junior College. 
        My passion lies in creating engaging and visually appealing web experiences while ensuring they are functional, fast, and user-friendly.
        Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend frameworks. 
        I also enjoy solving coding challenges that enhance my problem-solving mindset, and I believe every project is an opportunity to learn and grow.
